# CDT SETUP

Once LLDBMI2 is installed, 2 steps must be done to debug an application :

1. In "Run / Debug configurations...", create a new "C/C++ Application" and change the GDB debugger (in Debugger tab) from GDB to LLDBMI2. Options to LLDMI2 may be set there. Something like "/usr/local/bin/lldbmi2 --log".

2. In project's properties (or best in Eclipse preferences), "C/C++ Build" tab, "Environment" section, set the LLDB's framework or dynamic library path which is required by LLDBMI2. It can be done with environment variable DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH depending on the installation (see "LLDB framework" section).

3. In project's properties (or best in Eclipse preferences), "C/C++ Build" tab, "Environment" section, set the path for DEBUGSERVER which is required by LLDB's library. It can be done with environment variable DEBUGSERVER_PATH.

Note: If the environment is set in Eclipse preference, it will bet set for all projects once.
In my case it looks like:
- LLDB_DEBUGSERVER_PATH: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/LLDB.framework/Resources/debugserver
	DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH: ~/projects/llvm/release/lib
